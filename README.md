[SPA](http://zhaoda.github.io/spa/docs/) is designed to build a WebApp view transformation and routing control framework.

SPA build WebApp focus on solving common problems encountered, especially for building MobileApp, unlike [jQuery Mobile](http://jquerymobile.com/), [Sencha Touch](http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/) and other frameworks, building mobile client application is not a front-end integrated solutions with SPA, so we do not include UI components, if you do not want to design their own interface, you can use the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and other UI Components frame with SPA, to quickly build your WebApp.

SPA need to use [Zepto](http://zeptojs.com/) or [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), and each view can be [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/), [Sea.js](http://seajs.org/docs/) other CommonJS solutions or customize the way modular organization, asynchronous loading.

SPA support mobile client browser and the desktop side modern browsers.
